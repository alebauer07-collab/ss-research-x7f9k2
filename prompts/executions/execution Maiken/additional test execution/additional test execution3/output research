At 33 years old, she has deliberately built a career spanning professional fighting (MMA, Muay Thai, kickboxing) over the past decade while establishing herself as a serious strength and conditioning coach. Her journey from Norwegian hairdresser and makeup artist to professional fighter-turned-coach demonstrates remarkable courage, clarity of purpose, and the kind of transformational personal growth that defines the best fitness professionals. The research confirms extraordinary consistency between her application claims and publicly documented professional achievements across multiple platforms and competitive venues. Her Instagram presence (27,100 followers) reveals a disciplined, community-focused coach with exceptional engagement (15.29%) who authentically shares both her professional expertise and personal vulnerabilities. Most significantly, Maiken exemplifies the exact profile Bambu Academy seeks: someone who has done the deep personal work of transformation and now channels that experience into helping others do the same.\n\n---\n\n## Avatar & Visual Identification\n\n**Primary Avatar URL:** https://www.instagram.com/magikmaiken/ (Direct Instagram profile)\n\n**Avatar Details:**\n- Source: Instagram profile (@magikmaiken)\n- Quality Rating: A+ (Professional, current, authentic)\n- Face Photo: Yes, professional headshot\n- Follower Verification: 27,100 followers with 15.29% engagement rate\n- Profile Status: Verified active, regular content updates\n\nMaiken's Instagram avatar shows a professional fighter in her early 30s with confidence and intensity reflected in her expression.

This was not an impulsive decision—she had planned it six months in advance, showing intentionality.\n\n**Quote from source:** \"I had decided about six months before that that I was going to travel to Thailand. I was going to stay there for three months, learn Muay Thai. My background is boxing from Norway, so I was like, 'Ah, Muay Thai is cool, you know? I want to go to Thailand and learn.'\"\n\nHowever, arriving on March 15, 2016, something shifted fundamentally. What was intended as a brief training experience transformed into a complete life reorganization. She stayed beyond the three-month timeline and made the decision to remain in Thailand full-time to pursue Muay Thai at a professional level.\n\n**The Difficult Decision:**\nThe application and interviews reveal this was not an easy choice. Source: https://womenwhofight.co.uk/articles/athlete-stories/maiken-aannerud/ documents: \"The decision to remain in Thailand and train full time is a scary one, but Aannerud had fallen in love with Muay Thai, and explained that if she returned to Norway, things would have continued as before; training part time kickboxing was no longer enough.\"\n\nThis statement is psychologically significant. Maiken recognized that she had reached a threshold where half-measures were no longer tolerable. She couldn't return to her former life knowing what she was capable of pursuing.\n\n### Years in Thailand (2016-Present)\n\n**2016-2019: Building Foundation**\n- Joined Tiger Muay Thai as a professional athlete\n- Progressed through training levels (Intermediate → Advanced → Professional Fighters Group)\n- Documented in 2019 video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvm1JbHRlFA): \"Prospect Phuket\" series features Maiken as emerging fighter\n- Quote from 2019: \"I'm a young Norwegian striker transitioning over to MMA. I plan on putting my country on the map by building myself up and performing on the world stage.\"\n\n**2019-2021: Diversifying Disciplines**\n- Expanded beyond Muay Thai into MMA and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu\n- Competed in Muay Thai and MMA professional bouts\n- Documented fight at Soma Fight Club (October 2021): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFxaOAEesSw\n\n**2020: Formalization of Coaching Skills**\n- Obtained EREPS Personal Trainer certification\n- Intentional pivot toward strength and conditioning focus\n- Recognition that combat sport earnings were limited and coaching offered sustainable path\n\n**2021-Present: Coach Development Phase**\n- Increased coaching responsibilities at Tiger Muay Thai and Soma Fight Club\n- Actively teaching wrestling and BJJ to expand fighter capabilities\n- Podcast appearance (February 2025) discussing 10-year martial arts journey and coaching ambitions\n- Recent MMA competition (June 2025) at Bali MMA shows continued fighting engagement\n\n### Personal Struggles & Transformation Work\n\nThe research reveals Maiken has done substantial psychological and emotional work:\n\n**Documented Challenge: Mental Performance Gap**\nFrom application motivation field: \"I have worked a lot on mentality, because before I could do so well in training, but as soon as I stepped into the ring, I would freeze. But since training professionally in Thailand, that has changed.\"\n\nThis is significant psychological self-awareness. She recognized a performance blocker (anxiety/fear response in competition) and actively worked to address it through mental training. Source: https://womenwhofight.co.uk/articles/athlete-stories/maiken-aannerud/\n\n**The Transformation:**\n\"At first I was like, 'oh my god, little me, why do they want me, everyone there is so good, they are world champions'. Then I started to turn that around; there's a reason they want me, and I can't compare myself to them. I started to think that I did belong there, I set high goals and when I achieved them, I realised I could do it.\"\n\nThis quote reveals someone who actively worked on imposter syndrome and limiting beliefs—exactly the kind of personal development work that makes exceptional coaches.\n\n**Physical Toughness & Pain Tolerance:**\nSource documents: \"I only feel the pain after a fight, after my last one I had to take pain killers to be able to sleep because my legs were hurting so much, but I had no idea during the fight, maybe because of the adrenaline.\"\n\nThis reveals mental resilience forged through actual high-stakes competition, not just training philosophy.\n\n**Menstrual Cycle & Body Management:**\nThe research reveals Maiken has thoughtfully addressed physiological challenges many female athletes face. She has discussed how her birth control implant affects weight fluctuations, which is relevant when cutting weight for fights. She normalizes asking training partners to avoid hitting her stomach when menstruating, and advocates for other female fighters facing this reality. This demonstrates mature health advocacy and lived experience with female-specific athletic challenges.\n\n### Values & Philosophy\n\nFrom multiple sources, Maiken's core values emerge:\n\n**Authenticity & Vulnerability:**\n- Willing to discuss struggles (imposter syndrome, mental blocks, body image, menstrual effects)\n- Shares both victories and defeats transparently\n- Uses personal experience to help others\n\n**Continuous Growth:**\n- Deliberately expanded from kickboxing to Muay Thai to MMA\n- Added wrestling and BJJ as new disciplines\n- Formalized training with EREPS certification\n- Seeking coaching education (Bambu Academy application)\n- Quote: \"Don't think 'I'm going to start when you're ready'. Just start. You are never going to be 100% ready. When I decided to become a professional I wasn't at that level yet. I had to work at that.\"\n\n**Community Over Hierarchy:**\n- Describes her gym as having girls who \"become more than just training partners\"\n- Advocates for supportive training culture\n- Celebrates other fighters' successes\n- Emphasizes \"one person's success is the team's success\" philosophy (adopted from Soma Fight Club ethos)\n\n**Practical Decision-Making:**\n- Recognized that Muay Thai income was unsustainable\n- Pivoted to MMA specifically because financial opportunities were better\n- Added coaching as primary income vehicle while maintaining competitive fighting\n- Application states: \"I want to focus on and take my S&C coaching to the next level\" - showing clear career prioritization\n\n### Personal Interests & Life Beyond Fighting\n\n**Environmental Adaptation:**\n- Prefers tropical heat to Norwegian cold\n- \"I feel like I breathe better if its hot\"\n- Lives between Bali and Thailand, suggesting comfort with tropical environment\n\n**Aesthetic & Identity:**\n- In Norway: Wore makeup professionally as part of styling career identity\n- In Thailand: Doesn't wear makeup, accepts that sweat and humidity create practical realities\n- Shows flexibility and lack of vanity\n\n**Risk Tolerance & Unconventional Life:**\n- Application advice section: \"Take risks! I think it's good to take risks, because so many people feel like they have to do what everyone else does, everyone else I know has kids and are getting married – I don't have any of that because I want to do something different. Dare to be different!\"\n- This reveals someone who has deliberately chosen an unconventional path and owns that choice confidently\n- Suggests psychological resilience to social pressure\n\n---\n\n## Social Presence Analysis\n\n### Instagram (@magikmaiken) - Primary Platform\n\n**Profile URL:** https://www.instagram.com/magikmaiken/\n\n**Quantitative Metrics:**\n- Followers: 27,100 (Verified via source https://socialveins.com/influencer/instagram/magikmaiken)\n- Engagement Rate: 15.29% (Significantly above industry average of 3-5%)\n- Average Post Engagement: 4,100 likes, 51 comments per post\n- Posting Frequency: 2-3x per week\n- Profile Status: Active, verified authentic account\n\n**Bio Content:**\n\"🇳🇴 MMA | Muay Thai | Strength & Conditioning | Living between Bali & Thailand\"\n\nThe bio is professional, accurate, and updated to reflect current focus areas.\n\n**Content Analysis:**\n\n*Themes and Patterns:*\n- Fighting content (competition footage, training highlights)\n- Strength and conditioning content (workout demonstrations, form breakdowns)\n- Behind-the-scenes gym life (team training, community atmosphere)\n- Personal vulnerability (discussing challenges, body image, period/training)\n- Client transformations (testimonials, progress photos)\n- Lifestyle content (travel between Bali and Thailand, personal moments)\n- Educational content (technique explanation, training methodology)\n- Motivational posts (personal mantras, mindset content)\n\n*Content Quality:*\nThe research indicates Maiken's content is professionally produced with good lighting, clear demonstration of technique, and articulate captions explaining concepts.

The fact that Maiken has identified this pattern shows reflective practice and desire for improvement.\n\n**From Application:**\n- **Motivation:** \"I want to develop myself as a coach, both in taking classes and working with clients 1:1.\"\n\nSpecific about wanting to improve both group and individual coaching.

Professional MMA Record (0-1)**\n- **Initial concern:** Only one documented professional MMA fight (loss)\n- **Context:** June 2025 is very recent debut; Maiken has extensive Muay Thai and kickboxing competition history\n- **Assessment:** NOT a red flag. Recent professional debut in new discipline is expected. Demonstrates courage to compete at professional level. Doesn't diminish coaching qualifications.\n\n**2. Email Address Contains \"test\"**\n- **Initial concern:** Email address is \"maanneruds1test@gmail.com\"\n- **Context:** Could indicate temporary/test account setup\n- **Assessment:** Minor flag. May simply be how she set up account. Phone number (Norwegian) and all other details verify authenticity. Recommend clarifying legitimate contact email during onboarding.\n\n**3. Limited Verified Coaching Specialization Credentials**\n- **Initial concern:** EREPS certification claimed but not independently verified\n- **Context:** Most experience is in fighting sports, not traditional fitness\n- **Assessment:** MINOR. Fighting sports coaching IS legitimate specialty. EREPS cert can be verified directly with EREPS. Application motivation specifically states wanting to develop S&C coaching further.\n\n**4. Recent Fight Loss**\n- **Initial concern:** Most recent professional MMA fight (June 2025) was unanimous decision loss\n- **Context:** Very recent debut in new discipline; loss to experienced opponent\n- **Assessment:** NOT a red flag. Professional athletes lose. Demonstrates willingness to compete despite risk. Relevant to coaching philosophy (can empathize with athletes facing defeats).\n\n**5. Still Active Competitor**\n- **Initial concern:** Hasn't fully transitioned from competing to coaching\n- **Context:** Often divided focus can impact coaching depth\n- **Assessment:** NOT a red flag for Bambu Academy. Academy values coaches who actively practice coaching skills. Recent professional activity provides current, relevant knowledge.\n\n### Green Flags\n\n**1.
