## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

1. **Be thorough but efficient** — search smart, not exhaustive
2. **Note uncertainties** — if you can't verify something, say so
3. **No assumptions** — only report what you can find/verify
4. **Privacy conscious** — don't dig into personal non-professional info
5. **Document sources** — note where you found each piece of info
6. **Stay objective** — report facts, not judgments
